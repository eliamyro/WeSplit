WeSplit

A check-splitting iOS app that you might use after eating at a restaurant. You enter the cost of your food, select how much of a tip you want to leave, and how many people you’re with, and it will tell you how much each person needs to pay.

Based on the Paul Hudson's book «Hacking with iOS: SwiftUI Edition.»
